#Commodore Vic-20 Arduino Powered IR Light Gun

This is a fork of the SAMCO - Arduino Powered IR Light Gun project with a focus on applying the same concept, but altered to interface with the commodore Vic-20.

How it works? 
I plan to alter the hardware and software to control two digital pentiometers in place of passing the mouse position via usb. The Commodore Vic-20 currently supports two paddles that are essentially just two potentiometers and two buttons. My thought is to translate the potentiometer values to XP and YP values in a Commdore Vic-20 program.
